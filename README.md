## What is 42?

[42](https://www.42.fr) is a private, non-profit and tuition-free **engineering and programming school** based on **peer-to-peer learning** and **hands-on projects**. It offers a flexible 3-5 years self-paced and tuition-free curriculum.

42's educational model is qualified as innovative and is unlike any other program: **no teachers, courses or classes, no tuition, no fees and no grades required to enter the school**. The only admission requirements are to be 18+ years old and then to complete the entrance examination: *'la Piscine'*.

A Piscine (that means *'swimming pool'* in French) is a 4-week intensive and immersive coding bootcamp, 7 days a week. No previous programming experience required. 900 applicants learn C programming and bash scripting through daily exercises. Selected candidates (appr. 250 for Paris and until 2018 since the process changed in 2019) can register to be full-time students at 42, a tuition-free engineering school.

## New curriculum

A new curriculum was launched in fall 2019. You can find some of my former projects [here](former-cursus). The new curriculum includes both former projects and new projects related to networking and system administration.

A few information:
* took and passed Piscine in 2019
* study at Paris Campus
* simultanuesly studying at ESSEC Business School

## Project list

Redoing [Piscine C](https://github.com/matboivin/piscine-C-reiteration) one year after for fun and improvement.

### The Norm

(If you are wondering why we don't use many built-in functions and `for` loops)

The Norm is 42 style guideline and **apply for all programs written in C**. A single Norm Error leads to the grade of 0/100.

* forbidden functions: almost all the Standard C Library functions except `read`, `open`, `write`, `malloc` and `free` for some projects
* 25 lines per function maximum (without external brackets) and 84 characters per line maximum
* no more than 5 functions in a .c file and no more than 5 variables per function, no comments within a function's body
* `for` loops are forbidden

and so forth...
